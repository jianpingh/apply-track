# ðŸš€ Quick Deployment Checklist

## Before Deployment

- [ ] **Environment Variables Ready**
  - [ ] Supabase URL and keys configured
  - [ ] Authentication secrets set
  - [ ] Database connection verified

- [ ] **Code Quality Checks**
  - [ ] All TypeScript errors resolved
  - [ ] Build test passes: `npm run build`
  - [ ] Linting passes: `npm run lint`

- [ ] **Database Setup**
  - [ ] All required tables created in Supabase
  - [ ] RLS policies configured
  - [ ] Test data populated (optional)

## Deployment Steps

### Method 1: Using Deployment Script (Recommended)
```bash
npm run deploy
```

### Method 2: Manual Vercel CLI
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI (if not installed)
npm install -g vercel

# Deploy to preview
vercel

# Deploy to production
vercel --prod
```

### Method 3: GitHub Integration
1. Push code to GitHub
2. Connect repository in Vercel dashboard
3. Configure environment variables
4. Deploy automatically

## Environment Variables for Vercel

Set these in Vercel Dashboard â†’ Project â†’ Settings â†’ Environment Variables:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL = https://your-project-id.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY = your_service_role_key
NEXTAUTH_SECRET = your_32_character_secret
NODE_ENV = production
```

## Post-Deployment Testing

- [ ] **Authentication**
  - [ ] Sign up works
  - [ ] Login works
  - [ ] Sign out works
  - [ ] Protected routes redirect properly

- [ ] **Dashboard Functionality**
  - [ ] Student dashboard loads
  - [ ] Parent dashboard accessible
  - [ ] User profile displays correctly
  - [ ] Navigation works

- [ ] **Database Operations**
  - [ ] Creating applications works
  - [ ] Reading university data works
  - [ ] Profile updates work
  - [ ] Data persists correctly

- [ ] **UI/UX**
  - [ ] All text is in English
  - [ ] Responsive design works
  - [ ] Loading states display
  - [ ] Error handling works

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Build Failures
- Check TypeScript errors: `npm run type-check`
- Verify all imports are correct
- Ensure all dependencies are installed

### Authentication Issues
- Update Supabase Auth redirect URLs
- Check NEXTAUTH_URL environment variable
- Verify authentication callbacks

### Database Connection Issues
- Check Supabase service status
- Verify environment variables
- Test API routes locally

## Useful Commands

```bash
# Check deployment status
vercel ls

# View deployment logs
vercel logs [deployment-url]

# Download deployment for debugging
vercel inspect [deployment-url]

# Remove deployment
vercel remove [deployment-name]
```

## Success Indicators

âœ… Your deployment is successful when:
- Application loads at the Vercel URL
- Users can sign up and log in
- Dashboards display correctly with English text
- Database operations work
- All API routes respond properly
